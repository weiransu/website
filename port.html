			<p>&nbsp Ever since I took my first class related to computer science in high school (AP Computer Science A), I have been fascinated by this field of study. My curiosity was limitless as in addition to the various projects and assignments assigned to us in school, I took on quite a few side projects in addition to get more practice with different languages and trains of thought. From the simple Hello World programs in each language, to slightly more complicated programs such as creating a calculator using GUI or even recreating the popular arcade game Frogger, each program has, in its own way, taught me an important lesson both about my abilities and limits, but also about the world of computer science itself. In addition, I am currently working on creating a website designed for students that need help with their coursework to be able to find a tutor online and through webcam communication, be able to receive help. While many websites such as Chegg and Course Hero exist online for this, most of these cost a large sum of money to be paid annually or monthly just to be able to access a large quantity of textbook answers and also being able to see questions asked by other students. With my website, not only is the pay specified to one session at a time, so that this way, no part of the fee is wasted if the site isnâ€™t used at all, but the webcam communication allows for a much more personal feel to it. It is as if the tutor is right there with the student in the same room communicating as if they were friends rather than creating a rigid teacher-student relationship that can cause some students to feel intimidated or even nervous to seek help from the tutor.</p>
