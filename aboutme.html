			<p>I am currently a junior computer science student attending Texas A&M University primarily interested in software development, application design, and data science. I was born in Beijing, China and came to the United States in 2007.  
				My first exposure to computer science was in high school when I took AP Computer Science A. Since then, I have been working not only on projects assigned to me by my classes but also side projects that I take on that I have a strong interest in.</p>
